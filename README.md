[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/viniciusgama/jenkins-pipeline](https://badges.gitter.im/viniciusgama/jenkins-pipeline.svg)](https://gitter.im/viniciusgama/jenkins-pipeline?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge) [![Build Status](https://snap-ci.com/jenkins-pipeline/jenkins-pipeline/branch/master/build_image)](https://snap-ci.com/jenkins-pipeline/jenkins-pipeline/branch/master)

An attempt to display a set of builds running in Jenkins as a pipeline, a sequence of builds and its states.

## Setup

The project was developed with ruby version `ruby 2.0.0p481` and should work with versions above that.
The client is written in JavaScript and have its instructions on its [README](https://github.com/viniciusgama/jenkins-pipeline/blob/master/client/README.md).

## Files and Directories Dependencies

You gonna need to create a `config` directory and a `.env` file in order to run the project.

### config directory

Create in the root of the project a `config` directory with your pipeline config files (yml) based on the example provided by one of the maintainers.

### jenkins jobs configuration (folder)
In case of grouping your jobs in [folders](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/CloudBees+Folders+Plugin) you can speficy the root folder on the configuration

In order to the single pipeline endpoint to work, you will have to add a attribute `url` to your config file. E.g: `url: web-app` will generate an endpoint '/api/piplelines/web-app'

### .env file

Create an `.env` file in your repository with the following format

```
MONITOR_USERNAME=[YOUR JENKINS USERNAME]
MONITOR_TOKEN=[YOUR API TOKEN IN JENKINS]
```

# Running Application
